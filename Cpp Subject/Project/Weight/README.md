## Questions
Create a class *Weight* that stores a weight internally in pounds. Create func-
tions *setWeightPounds*, *setWeightKilograms*, and *setWeightOunces* that
take an input weight in the specified weight scale, convert the weight to pounds
if required, and store that weight in the classâ€™s member variable. Also, create
functions that return the stored weight in pounds, kilograms, and ounces.
Write a main function to test your class. Use the equations shown next to
convert between the weight scales.

- 1 pound = 16 ounces
- 1 kilogram = 2.21 pounds
