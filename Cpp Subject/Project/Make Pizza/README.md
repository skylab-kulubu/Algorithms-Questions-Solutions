Define a class called Pizza that has member variables to track the type of pizza
(either deep dish, hand tossed, or pan) along with the size (either small, medium,
or large) and the number of pepperoni or cheese toppings. You can use constants to
represent the type and size. Include mutator and accessor functions for your class.
Create a void function, outputDescription( ), that outputs a textual description
of the pizza object. Also include a function, computePrice( ), that computes the
cost of the pizza and returns it as a double according to the following rules:

- Small pizza = $10 + $2 per topping
- Medium pizza = $14 + $2 per topping
- Large pizza = $17 + $2 per topping

Write a suitable test program that creates and outputs a description and price of
various pizza objects.
